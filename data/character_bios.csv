Linus generally considers himself an outcast of the town. He does not trust people and doesn't seem to consider anyone in town his friend due to the fact that most people don't treat him well. However, based on dialogue found in data files, Linus is friends with the Wizard, who is seen standing next to Linus during the Spirit's Eve Festival. This exception may be because Linus does not consider the Wizard to be part of the townsfolk. During Festivals, he can usually be found alone and out of the way. At one point, Linus tells the player that his tent has been destroyed before. Robin mentions that she doesn't mind him living behind their house as long as he doesn't bother them.
