# Named-Entity Recognition  
  
This code captures the intention of actionable dialogue with the NPC. Using a couple of [Spacy Matchers](https://spacy.io/api/matcher), the dialogue is analyzed to see whether any actionable intent was expressed. The code can identify whether a buying transaction was initiated (if the user is buying an item from the NPC), whether an item quest was given to the user, or whether a mob quest was given to the user. When one of these patterns are present, the code identifies which pattern was detected, and then identifies the specific keywords that are important for the transaction. For a buy pattern, the specific item to be bought, the quantity, and the cost is identified. For an item quest, the item requested, the quantity requested, and the reward upon request completion is identified. For a mob quest, the mob to be found or slain, the quantity to be found or slain, and the reward upon completion is identified. Using this information, the transaction can be dynamically implemented in game.
